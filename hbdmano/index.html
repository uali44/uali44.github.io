                <h3>The day it started</h3>
                <p>I always wanted to meet you to tell you that yes I exist and how and who am I but you never let me. And then finally it was the day when we 
decided to be go on a journey together ... pehli dafa ma hi direct bara chakka .... so I was a bit nervous and a lot of happy when I got on bike to get to bus.But when 

I got into bus it was a shock plus I got worried too and I was thinking may be they gonna pick more passengers or whats gonna happen and whats about to happen. Plus I 

was worried about how would you feel about it and I thought .... okay this seems to be ending here .... at least I might get a chance to see you in person for once in 

my life. And yes I was mesmerized when I looked at you .... you were looking amazing .... although I was worried and having mixed feelings about things but still was 

sure of one thing that im lucky to be able to see you. you were asking what I think ... what could I tell you?....... I really wanted that trip to happen it was a long 

awaited wish but at the same time I was worried about how things were looking at the time .... to I was like ....... "ik dil kahy mera haan keh don ik dil kehta hy 

naaaaaa".........   when we decided that we should go .... I had so many mixed emotions and thoughts that I couldnt tell you anything .... and plus I couldnt tell 

because I didnt want you to burden with more thoughts than you were having already.. 
<strong>But despite everything this was where the most beautiful journey of my entire life started</strong>

                <h3>First night</h3>
                <p>I know im skipping those beautiful words we exchanged and the time when I looked at how beautiful you look while sleeping. But finally we reached 

kumrat. when we were in jeep and you were scared , I wanted to say that grab my hand to feel better but I couldnt. when we reached finally in hotel I was worried about 

you . But then when we walked and talked ... in the dark ... when you were sitting on that stone ... that is a priceless memory .....then we talked ... we enjoyed that 

bonefire. we walked around .... the glow in your eyes were so beautiful.... then again when you went to your room for sleep I was again a bit worried for you because 

we couldnt even talk there and you were alone.... but then we both slept and woke up to have those new and fresh beautifull adventures ,,,   </p>

                <h3>The beautifull waterfall and your beautiful smile </h3>
                <p>Then our next journey began ... we were in the jeep going to that beautiful waterfall. And you were looking beautiful. I remember it all your smile. 

This was our first day when we started enjoying it the way it was suppose to be enjoyed. We sang songs. we talked laughed . Clicked pictures. We were living every 

moment  without caring about anything in life. I was so happy looking at you enjoying and smiling and laughing like that. Then in the middle of the road when we 

stopped. You picked up rocks ... and It was beautiful to see you doing that ... then weather took a turn and it started raining and everything became more beautiful.

                <h3>OUR NEXT BIG CHALLANGE</h3>
                <p>Then our next challange started . The long journey with a lot of hardship. Thank you soooooooooooo much for walking with me in the start and keeping 

it up. I know I'm not doing justice to it because every single moment was very special . khair .... we started our next  journey to jahaz baanda. I know I was pushing 

you a bit ... I dont know k tmhen kesa lag rha hoga tb .... you can tell me later but I'm really glad you did push past your limits enough and then you went ahead on 

horse. I Was worried or you because I didnt know whats up there and you are the first one to arrive there so it was a bit tense . But happiness of being a part of a 

journey where you were was very much overwhelming. And finally we met again on that dhaaba and you again went ahead... At the end when we finally reached the Top I was 

releved to know that everything was fine and you already had found your hotel. The view was beautiful but most beautiful in all that was you with your magical smile 

and shining bright eyes ...Then in the night you looked adorable trying to make the bonefire.<strong> Those nights were literally the embodiment of all the songs we 

sing together </strong> the beautiful moon ... wo ratain wo mosam nadiii ka kinaaraa or chanchal hawa..... or ham tum kitny paas thy kitny dour thy chaand sitaary... 

Those were very very beautiful moments when we were talking and walking under that sky with shining bright moon. halki c sardii ... tmhari meethi awaz .... singing 

songs together.... it was all magical... a dream came true...    </p>

                <h3>Journey to mini katora</h3>
                <p>The next day we started our next journey.. you were looking beautiful in that white dress unfortunately I wasnt able to match the vibe due to 

circumstances there I wish things would have been different and I could get the chance to match your vibe by dressing accordigly although that was the orignal plan and 

I had packed cloths accordinly.But due to conditions there they were sooooooo risky to wear...Anyway we started our next journey... we went to mini katooora on horses 

... it was beautiful that we were going almost together... and little did we knew k ye kharab tasveerain sirf camera or light ki waja se ni bal k we are victims or 

sunburns. But it was worth it... we did enjoyed a bit on this side ... playing badminton with you was another fun ... I was more focused on you than the shuttle. you 

were a beautiful distraction.. After that it was a joyess sight to see you enjoying in the boat ... Then we had fun while slipping on the snow, walking up and enjoying 

it there. Meanwhile somehow all your things were shifting to my hands slowly and that was a very pleasent change. You were free and enjoying every moment. And it was 

filling me with joy and happiness. Then on the way back it started raining ... you started running and it was worrysome. But at the same time I was glad that you are 

in your own way enjoying. Although when we reached back you were not feeling so good and I was worried because i didnt want you to be sick or anything like that.
But when you rested and came out after some time I was releaved to see you were better and feeling better too. Then we went to other group members and played badminton 

and ludo and then walked a bit again enjoying the weather. But I was worried about your foot and knee. 
        </p>
 <p>I was vert happy about everything. It was a <b>DREAM</b>. I was happy that you are feeling good and enjoying everything. Then after dinner when I was sitting in 

your room till late. I was thinking about how this is the last night of this dream like magical journey and tommorow we will again be aprt . You were asking me why I 

was looking at you like that and actually I wanted to capture every moment of it when I could look at you like that sitting ,almost laying in front of me, in flesh. 

It was embodiment of those lines

                <h3>ThE WAY BACK </h3>
               <p> Then the next morning was another beautiful bright morning like your shining smile. we walked a bit and then started hiking downward. jab tm bhaagti 

thi to dil opar neechy hota tha mera. Thats why I was trying to stay close to you. But I'm glad k asa koi time ni aaya jis ma zyada koi masla hota. It was beautiful 

experience walking alongside you on that path. But in the midway some good moments were just waiting for us when you got tired and we stopped and sat there. Talked a 

bit ,absorbed each others presence. The glow on your face was so bright, and then we had pictures along the way before reaching taki top and talked more . And then it 

started that journey in the jeep. I could look at you and were so close to you, your hair were flying and touching my face in between. It was another beautiful 

surprize that this journey had in store for me. After reaching back to thal, thanks to changaiz khan we had some more time to spend together. I wanted to give your 

something , something tangible to have with you to remember this beautiful journey but couldnt find anything.We had some special moments there while walking around in 

markete and sitting on the shore of that river. Then we boarded bus and started our journey back to the point where it started. I was sad because of it all ending. But 

like all journeys this was bound to end . <br/>
<strong>
we reached back and went our seprate ways but all those memories , your presence , your smile, tmhari khushbo, all stayed with me.  
Im so very very thankful that I have been blessed with your presence in my life. And I'm very thankful to you for giving me those beautiful magical moments to truely 

live my life.
